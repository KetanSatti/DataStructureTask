📘 DataStructureTask

A Java project demonstrating basic data structure operations, sorting algorithms, and array manipulations.
This project was built in NetBeans IDE and integrated with GitHub to practice version control (branches, merges, conflict resolution).

🚀 Features
✅ Sorting Algorithms

Selection Sort – Ascending order implementation.

Bubble Sort – Optimized with early exit (stops if already sorted).

Insertion Sort – Efficient for small arrays.

✅ Array Operations

Find Second Lowest (distinct) without using built-in sorting.

Find Second Highest (distinct) without using built-in sorting.

Handles duplicate numbers safely.

✅ Input Handling

Accepts integer input from the user.

Rejects invalid input with a retry prompt.

🖥️ Example Usage

Enter 5 different numbers (press Enter after each):
Number 1: 24
Number 2: 96
Number 3: 66
Number 4: 16
Number 5: 96

Choose sorting algorithm:
1 - Selection Sort
2 - Bubble Sort
3 - Insertion Sort
Enter choice (1/2/3): 2

Sorted array (ascending):
16 24 66 96 96 

Second lowest (distinct) number: 24  
Second-highest (distinct) number: 66

🔀 Git Workflow

This project was also used to practice Git branching and merging:

master → Main branch.

feature/sorting-logic → Added sorting algorithms with selection menu.

feature/array-operations → Added second-highest & second-lowest distinct functions.

Merge Conflicts were resolved in
src/datastructuresandgithubintegration/DataStructuresAndGitHubIntegration.java.

✔️ Both features were merged into master after conflict resolution.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 17

NetBeans IDE 27

Git & GitHub (branches, pull requests, merge conflict resolution)

📚 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/KetanSatti/DataStructureTask.git
cd DataStructureTask

2. Open in NetBeans IDE.

3. Run the project (Shift + F6).

4. Follow on-screen instructions to input numbers and choose sorting algorithms.

✨ Future Improvements

Add support for merge sort and quick sort.

Implement unit tests with JUnit.

Extend array operations (e.g., median, mode, duplicates removal).
